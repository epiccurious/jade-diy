## Background

### What is a Jade?

[The Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) is a bitcoin-only hardware wallet that runs 100% on Open Source code.

The firmware that runs Jade can also run other general purpose hardware that shares the same ESP32 microcontroller.

### Motivation (Who Should Follow This Guide)

Why Should I Follow This Guide?

Three words: **supply chain attacks**.

You understand that the person who sells you hardware for your bitcoin shouldn't know you use it for bitcoin.

**WARNING:** Do not hold **more** than $100,000 (in 2023 prices) on **any** hardware wallet including the Jade. For large amounts, refer to the "Who Should NOT Follow This Guide?" section.

### Who Should NOT Follow This Guide?

1. You want to secure more than $100,000 (in 2023 dollars) worth of bitcoin. For large amounts, install Linux yourself on dedicated laptops and use multisig on Bitcoin Core following [a best-practices self-custody guide](https://yeticold.com).

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
2. You want to learn how to use the Jade hardware wallet. Refer to [the Jade's help center documentation](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/categories/900000061906-Blockstream-Jade/) or [contact Blockstream](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for software support.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

3. You can't be bothered to operate a computer through the command line. We will be using the Terminal console, which some people find scary. It's not hard, I promise.

4. You aren't willing to use [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop), macOS (running modern Arm-based hardware), or ChromOS. (This guide only supports Debian-based Linux, macOS, and ChromeOS for now but will eventually add support for other Linux distributions.)

### MUST READ: Keep Your DIY Jade Secured

**You need to control physical access to your DIY Jade**

Evil maid attacks, such as [this one done by hackers for a competitor](https://www.ledger.com/blog/firmware-extraction-evil-maid-attacks-on-blockstream-jade-hardware-wallet), will become easier and cheaper to perform over time.

It's not just a risk of someone hacking or altering YOUR device. An evil maid can also swap your device with a new malicious device. (For further reading, please see [[#1]](https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/fake-trezor-hardware-crypto-wallet/28299/), [[#2]](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9563-wallet_fail), [[#3]](https://blog.trezor.io/psa-non-genuine-trezor-devices-979b64e359a7), [[#4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220820031918/https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/o154gz/comment/h1zagmk/))

As a countermeasure to evil maid attacks, **you need to control physical access to your DIY Jade** hardware wallet at all times. Keep your DIY Jade locked up in a safe, lockbox, or some other method of restricting access. Don't let your house cleaner see it. 

### Current Limitations of Third-Party DIY Hardware

- No camera support. To build a DIY Jade with camera support, [please refer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2yVKag2wlc).
- Need a documented process for updating firmware.

## Hardware Options

You are better off buying the hardware directly from the hardware vendor than through a third-party channel like Amazon or Alibaba. In many cases, it's cheaper to buy direct too.

### TTGO T-Display

## Set-Up Instructions

There are three options for flashing your device:
- [**Install with the Semi-Automated Script**](#install-with-the-semi-automated-script) (easiest way)
- [**Install with a Device-Specific Script**](#install-with-a-device-specific-script) (another easy way)
- [**Install by Running the Code Manually**](#install-by-running-the-code-manually) (harder way)

### Use the Semi-Automated Script

This option is recommended for the average user who doesn't know how to read and write bash.

1. Read [this section about physically securing your DIY Jade]([MUST READ: Keep Your DIY Jade Secured](#must-read-keep-your-diy-jade-secured)).

2. Open the Terminal.
    - On Linux, press `Ctrl+Alt+T`.
    - On macOS, press `Command+Space`, type terminal, and press `return`.
    - on ChromeOS, install Linux under Settings -> Advanced -> Developers. Then press `üîç (search)` on the keyboard, type terminal and press `enter`.

3. Run the following command (via copy-paste) in Terminal.
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy/raw/master/flash_your_device)"
    ```

4. When the script asks, choose your device (#1-#4).

After the script completes, you should see the Jade initialization screen on your device.

### Use a Device-Specific Script

1. Read [this section about physically securing your DIY Jade]([MUST READ: Keep Your DIY Jade Secured](#must-read-keep-your-diy-jade-secured)).

2. Open the Terminal.
    - On Linux, press `Ctrl+Alt+T`.
    - On macOS, press `Command+Space`, type terminal, and press `return`.
    - on ChromeOS, install Linux under Settings -> Advanced -> Developers. Then press `üîç (search)` on the keyboard, type terminal and press `enter`.

3. Run one of the following commands (via copy-paste) in Terminal.
    - For the TTGO T-Dispay:
        ```
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy/raw/master/device_specific/flash_the_ttgo_tdisplay)"
        ```
    - For the M5Stack M5StickC PLUS:
        ```
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy/raw/master/device_specific/flash_the_m5stack_m5stickc_plus)"
        ```
    - For the M5Stack Core Basic:
        ```
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy/raw/master/device_specific/flash_the_m5stack_core_basic)"
        ```
    - For the M5Stack FIRE:
        ```
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://github.com/epiccurious/jade-diy/raw/master/device_specific/flash_the_m5stack_fire)"
        ```

After the script completes, you should see the Jade initialization screen on your device.

### Run the Commands Manually

This options is provided for people who want to run the commands themselves.

1. Read [this section about physically securing your DIY Jade]([MUST READ: Keep Your DIY Jade Secured](#must-read-keep-your-diy-jade-secured)).

2. Open the Terminal. On Linux, press `Ctrl+Alt+T`. On macOS, press `Command+Space`, type terminal, and press `return`.

3. Install the required software packages. On a slow computer, this step can take over 20 minutes. Copy-and-paste the following lines into Terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y cmake git python3-pip python3-venv
    [ -d ${HOME}/esp ] || mkdir ${HOME}/esp
    git clone -b v5.1.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git ${HOME}/esp/esp-idf
    cd "${HOME}"/esp/esp-idf
    ./install.sh esp32
    . ./export.sh
    ```
TODO: Add instructions for installing macOS dependendies.
  
4. Download the Jade source code. Copy-and-paste the following lines into Terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/blockstream/jade "${HOME}"/jade
    cd "${HOME}"/jade/
    git checkout $(git tag | grep -v miner | sort -V | tail -1)
    ```
  
5. Load the pre-built configuration file for your DIY hardware.
    - For the TTGO T-Display, run:
        ```bash
        cp configs/sdkconfig_display_ttgo_tdisplay.defaults sdkconfig.defaults
        ```
    - For the M5Stack M5StickC Plus, run:
        ```bash
        cp configs/sdkconfig_display_m5stickcplus.defaults sdkconfig.defaults
        ```
    - For the M5Stack Core, run:
        ```bash
        cp configs/sdkconfig_display_m5blackgray.defaults sdkconfig.defaults
        ```
    - For the M5Stack Fire, run:
        ```bash
        cp configs/sdkconfig_display_m5fire.defaults sdkconfig.defaults
        ```

6. Modify the configuration file you just loaded to disable logging in debug mode (a.k.a. "research and development" mode).
    ```bash
    sed -i.bak '/CONFIG_DEBUG_MODE/d' ./sdkconfig.defaults
    sed -i.bak '1s/^/CONFIG_LOG_DEFUALT_LEVEL_NONE=y\n/' sdkconfig.defaults
    rm sdkconfig.defaults.bak
    ```

7. Build the firmware.
    ```
    idf.py build
    ```

8. Connect your device to your computer via USB.

9. Enable read-write permissions for your device.
    ```bash
    [ -f /dev/ttyACM0 ] && sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ttyACM0
    [ -f /dev/ttyUSB0 ] && sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```
TODO: Add macOS instructions.

10. Flash (install) Jade onto your device. On a slow computer, this step can take over 10 minutes. Run the following command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    idf.py -b 115200 flash
    ```

11. Either disable read-write permissions for your device or disconnect it. (Default permissions will be restored when you re-connect it.)
    ```bash
    [ -f /dev/ttyACM0 ] && sudo chmod o-rw /dev/ttyACM0
    [ -f /dev/ttyUSB0 ] && sudo chmod o-rw /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

After the build and flash process completes, you should see the Jade initialization screen on your device.
